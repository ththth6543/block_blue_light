# Block Blue Light

A Flutter application designed to reduce eye strain by filtering out blue light from your screen. This app helps you sleep better and protects your eyes from the harmful effects of blue light, especially during night time.

## Features

- **Blue Light Filtering:** Applies a warm color overlay on the screen to reduce blue light.
- **Adjustable Intensity:** Easily control the intensity of the filter to your preference.
- **Simple & Clean UI:** A minimalist and intuitive user interface.
- **Scheduling:** Set a schedule for the filter to automatically turn on and off. (Coming soon!)
- **Lightweight:** The app is designed to be lightweight and consume minimal battery.
